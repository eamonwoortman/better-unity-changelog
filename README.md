# Better Unity3D Changelog

**Better Unity3D Changelog** is an attempt to fix the simplicity of Unity's changelogs pages.
It allows the user to filter a specific category, but also view [a range](https://better-unity-changelog.vercel.app/changelogs/2022.3.22/2022.3.25) of changelogs, so you can look for a specific upgrade related information.


## WIP Warning
Due to time constraints, this project isn't worked on. It's currently a work in progress, some features work but it may never finish.
